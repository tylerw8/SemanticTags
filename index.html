            <h2>Schooling</h2> 
            <h3>Grade School</h3>
            <p>I was born in Ogden, Utah on June 30, 1969.  Just a few days before man first stepped    foot on the moon.  My first memory of a computer was in elementary school.  Some college students came to my class to demostrate a lemonade stand game.  It was text based and they didn't allow the kids to spend too much time playing with it.</p>  
        
            <p>In Junior High I learned to type.  In my typing class we had six computers with word processing programs on them that students took turns using.  I really liked being able to easily correct my typos without using whiteout!  I also took a programming class that use IBM PET computers.  I remember making an ASCII rocket fly off the screen, but that's about it.</p>
        
            <p>I took another programming class in Basic in highschool.  The main thing I recall from that class is the excitement over computers that could produce "High-Rez" graphics.  My cousin had an Apple IIe which is where I was first introduced to text adventures and Apple computers.  It would be many more years before I owned an Apple computer of my own.</p>
        
            <p>In highschool I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for a career.  I liked my Psychology class, I liked my art classes, and I liked computers, but I didn't know of a career where I could combined those interests.  It wasn't until college when I took a class to help students decide on a major that I learned about Humand Factors.  It sounded like a perfect fit.  It uses Pyschology to help design better technology based on human needs and capabilities.  Unfortunately the school I was attending at the time did not have a Human Factors program.
            </p>
        
            <h3>College</h3>
            <p>In December of 1991 I got married and moved to Indiana so my wife could finish her nursing degree.  Upon complettion of her degree she landed a job at the University of Utah hospital.  Her job provided a tuition discount for her spouse so I transferred to the <a href="http://www.utah.edu/">University of Utah</a> where I studied Cognitive Psyhology with Dr. David Strayer. The University of Utah had a program in Human Factors, but it was focused on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics#Physical_ergonomics">physical ergonomics</a>, and I was interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_ergonomics">cognitive ergonomics.</a>  Fortunately, Dr. Strayer had studied at the University of Illinois which has a great Human Factors program. </p>

            <h4>The dangers of texting and driving</h4>
            <p>Dr. Strayer later became one of the first researchers to identify the dangers of texting and driving.</p>
                <blockquote>"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that in 2010 driver distraction was the cause of 18 percent of all fatal crashes – with 3,092 people killed – and crashes resulting in an injury – with 416,000 people wounded." <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/guides/texting-while-driving">-FCC</a> </blockquote>
